# $\mathcal{\color{magenta}{Welcome \ to\ } \\color{orange}{ \ "MeteoSymfony"}}$<br>

Here I use version 6.<br>
I have already prepared a diagram in order to create clear makers.<br><br>

To create my database I directly used Laragon which proposes to create and name a site in Symfony version.<br>
I then installed it in vscode. I installed all necessary requirements for Symfony 6.<br>

The "Messaging" table I did not use the Symfony Mailer because my messaging is internal to the site. It has 2 foreign keys that come from Users: I therefore had to create 2 relationships.<br>
Once you understand how Symfony was organized, it's easy to understand the creation of classes and their locations.<br>
Entities are the reference classes, controllers are used to create paths, templates contain twig files to display, we can also use a form command that will take care of all our data, and even the connection is created on its own with the "auth" command...<br>
Creating data fixtures speeds up the work.<br>
I stored my images and my CSS and JS in a "public" folder.<br>
Do not forget to switch to "prod" version to also test "in real life".<br><br>

In short, the most interesting for me, remains the handling with PHP! :smile:<br>

// A detail to remember: Not all references are included in the Symfony maker: for this reason I added the CURRENT_TIMESTAMP myself, for example.
